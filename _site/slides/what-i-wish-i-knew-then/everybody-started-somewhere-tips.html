Nothing makes you different from your heroes beyond time and 
dedication. Nobody is ever born being the best at something, 
and so-called natural talent only gets you started, it doesn't 
get you to the top. Never let yourself forget what it's like 
to be a beginner, because that means you've stopped learning.
