Practice makes decent. Even if you suck at something, do it 
every day for a year and you'll get pretty good. Every new 
skill is worth having, you never know what sort of crazy 
stuff may come in handy one day. Skills build upon each other. 
Any little thing you learn will help make learning something 
else even easier.
