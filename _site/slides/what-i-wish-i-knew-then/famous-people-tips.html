Don't be scared to talk to someone just because they are "famous". 
Fame and success can be lonely, and it's harder to be seen as "just 
a normal person". Ask them the kind of questions nobody else would, 
questions which show you have genuine interest in their story. Try 
not to fangirl around too much, you'll blend into the sea of other fans.
