<!-- 
notes have to be back here because 
tabbing in causes them to otherwise 
be interpreted as code in markdown 
-->
There is no such thing as "I don't have enough time" - 
wipe that sentence from your vocabulary. Instead say 
"There are other things I would rather be doing". 
Everyone has the same amount of time in each day, 
your choice is how you spend it.
