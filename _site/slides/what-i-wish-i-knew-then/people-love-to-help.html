People love to help. They also love to talk about themselves. 
If you're ever looking at someone thinking "wow I wish I could 
be like them" or "I wish I knew how to do that", go and ask 
them for advice. Don't panic about not knowing much, just 
ask questions, show interest, and let them do the talking.
