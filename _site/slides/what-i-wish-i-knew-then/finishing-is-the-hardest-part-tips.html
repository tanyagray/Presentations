<!-- 
notes have to be back here because 
tabbing in causes them to otherwise 
be interpreted as code in markdown 
-->
Take small steps and always keep your goal in mind. 
Incremental progress and rewards help with focus. 
Make a habit of finishing, even small things, and 
celebrating completion. Finishing does feel amazing 
and if you can make a habit of it you'll be better 
for it.
