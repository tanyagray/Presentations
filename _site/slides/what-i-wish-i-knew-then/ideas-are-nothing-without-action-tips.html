<!-- 
notes have to be back here because 
tabbing in causes them to otherwise 
be interpreted as code in markdown 
-->
Use your free time wisely. There are only a certain number 
of hours in the day but you can choose whether to use them 
for achieving something meaningful, or for watching TV. 
Watch less TV. See what else you can find to do instead. 
Wherever possible, tell yourself to stop saying "I'll do 
it tomorrow".
