If fear is something you have to deal with, know 
that you are not alone. Channel it. Turn fear of 
failure into fear of doing nothing. If something 
is worth doing, it is worth doing badly. Never 
say no straight away, always at least consider 
saying yes. What is the worst that could happen? 
What is the best? Never miss an opportunity. 
Everything you make it through prepares you for 
the next hurdle.
