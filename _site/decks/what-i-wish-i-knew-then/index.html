For those of you who don't know me or have forgotten my name, 
my name is Tanya. I wrote my first line of code at age 10 and 
since then I have written hundreds of thousands more. There 
are a bunch of "pro tips" I've picked up on my journey and 
I'd like to share them with you.

Everybody started somewhere. The most successful people you 
know, anyone you wish you could be like, they were all born 
at a very young age, grew up, had goals, made choices, and 
ultimately got to where they are now through a lot of time 
and hard work.

Nothing makes you different from your heroes beyond time and 
dedication. Nobody is ever born being the best at something, 
and so-called natural talent only gets you started, it doesn't 
get you to the top. Never let yourself forget what it's like 
to be a beginner, because that means you've stopped learning.

Famous people are just people. There is no reason to put them 
up on a pedestal or think that they are better than you. When 
you meet someone famous, and you will, if you can talk to them 
like a regular human being and be down-to-earth with them, 
that is what they will remember.

Don't be scared to talk to someone just because they are "famous". 
Fame and success can be lonely, and it's harder to be seen as "just 
a normal person". Ask them the kind of questions nobody else would, 
questions which show you have genuine interest in their story. Try 
not to fangirl around too much, you'll blend into the sea of other fans.

People love to help. They also love to talk about themselves. 
If you're ever looking at someone thinking "wow I wish I could 
be like them" or "I wish I knew how to do that", go and ask 
them for advice. Don't panic about not knowing much, just 
ask questions, show interest, and let them do the talking.

So when you need help, ask for help. You will likely find it. 
If not, ask someone else. Be willing to admit when you don't 
know something. People appreciate honesty over false nods and 
agreement, even if you feel silly for not knowing. Listen to 
advice when you ask for it, and update the person later.

It's all about who you know. What you know is very important, 
but one of the easiest pathways through life is with the help 
and support of your network. Get to know people every chance 
you get. Find out not just their work but their hobbies. 
Connect on a memorable level.

Remembering names goes a long way. If you're not good at 
it don't worry, it is something you can learn - google it! 
Do what you can to meet people from all walks of life. 
Step outside your normal circles. Don't be afraid to name 
drop. It's not always about bragging, sometimes it's just 
a tiny endorsement that can capture someone's attention.

Any skill can be learned. It's true. Whether or not you 
believe that practice makes perfect... who needs perfect? 
Sometimes it helps to know a skill well enough to understand 
it, and so that you can have educated expectations of the 
people you work with.

Practice makes decent. Even if you suck at something, do it 
every day for a year and you'll get pretty good. Every new 
skill is worth having, you never know what sort of crazy 
stuff may come in handy one day. Skills build upon each other. 
Any little thing you learn will help make learning something 
else even easier.

Ideas are nothing without action. You can have the best idea 
in the world but it is worthless unless you put in the work 
required to bring it to life. The ability to actually focus, 
work, and get things done is a rare skill. If you can achieve 
that, you are well on the way to success.

Use your free time wisely. There are only a certain number 
of hours in the day but you can choose whether to use them 
for achieving something meaningful, or for watching TV. 
Watch less TV. See what else you can find to do instead. 
Wherever possible, tell yourself to stop saying "I'll do 
it tomorrow".

Finishing is the hardest part. Usually the saying is 
"starting is the hardest part" but I disagree. When 
you are working on a meaningful project, chances are 
it won't be easy. I prefer to live by the advice that 
the last 10% takes 90% of the total time.

Take small steps and always keep your goal in mind. 
Incremental progress and rewards help with focus. 
Make a habit of finishing, even small things, and 
celebrating completion. Finishing does feel amazing 
and if you can make a habit of it you'll be better 
for it.

Having said that, finishing is also overrated. It's 
super valuable to be able to identify when a project 
has gone stale or is no longer worth finishing. Learn 
how to cut your losses when that is the best option 
for yourself and for your project.

Sometimes what you learned through doing the project 
is actually the important part. For projects where 
you are not the only one invested in it, remember 
that your mental and physical health are more important 
than any job. If you walk away and later decide the 
project is still worth doing, you can always try again.

It's okay to be scared. It's healthy to be scared, 
it means you're aware of the consequences. Everybody 
deals with fear, even those who to you may look fearless. 
Just don't let being scared prevent you from doing 
awesome stuff.

If fear is something you have to deal with, know 
that you are not alone. Channel it. Turn fear of 
failure into fear of doing nothing. If something 
is worth doing, it is worth doing badly. Never 
say no straight away, always at least consider 
saying yes. What is the worst that could happen? 
What is the best? Never miss an opportunity. 
Everything you make it through prepares you for 
the next hurdle.

There is no such thing as "I don't have enough time" - 
wipe that sentence from your vocabulary. Instead say 
"There are other things I would rather be doing". 
Everyone has the same amount of time in each day, 
your choice is how you spend it.
