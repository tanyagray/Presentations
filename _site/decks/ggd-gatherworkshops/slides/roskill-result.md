![Mt Roskill Grammar is now teaching both web dev and Python](images/ggd-gatherworkshops.017.jpg)

Note:
Mt Roskill grammar is now teaching purely code-based web development, and this year is introducing Python programming to their curriculum. 

When I first met them none of these teachers had a clue about code, and all but one were apprehensive about HTML.
