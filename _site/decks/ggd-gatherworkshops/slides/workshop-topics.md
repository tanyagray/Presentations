Note:

Here's a quick overview of the workshops that we offer.

We've been running student and teacher workshops on-site in schools by request. 

We also plan to offer industry workshops to support our work in schools financially. We've done one so far and have plans for more in future. 

Our hope is that through industry sponsorship and industry workshops we can continue to heavily subsidise training for teachers.
