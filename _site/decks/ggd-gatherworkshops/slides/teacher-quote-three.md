![Quote from a teacher](images/ggd-gatherworkshops.022.jpg)

Note:
This person is the only digi tech teacher at the school, covering years 9-12. They abandoned yr 13 as only 4 students opted for it.

They describe their lack of understanding of the complexity of the strands/structure of DigiTech.

"There are not enough 'pathways' within the subject as I simply haven't gotten my head around how to deliver them in a consistent and constructive way, using one teacher (me), without 'diluting' what the subject has to offer."
