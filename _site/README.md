# Building the Web

These are the slides used for all Building the Web workshops.

## View the Slideshow

A live version of the slide deck is hosted on GitHub [here](http://nzgather.github.io/Building-the-Web/presentation).

You can jump to the following sections:

 - [Web Foundations](http://nzgather.github.io/Building-the-Web/presentation/webfoundations)
 - [Page Structure](http://nzgather.github.io/Building-the-Web/presentation/pagestructure)
 - [HTML Basics](http://nzgather.github.io/Building-the-Web/presentation/htmlbasics)
 - [CSS Basics](http://nzgather.github.io/Building-the-Web/presentation/cssbasics)
 - [Site Builder](http://nzgather.github.io/Building-the-Web/presentation/sitebuilder)

## Presenter Notes

Presenter notes are available by pressing the 's' key on your keyboard while viewing the live slide deck. Presenter notes are displayed in a new window, but navigation from the speaker notes are linked to the original window.

When presenting, the optimal layout is "extended desktop" rather than "mirror screens". You would then have the full screen slide deck on the projector screen, and the speaker notes displayed on your laptop.

## Dabblet Solutions

Every page which has a link to a code challenge on Dabblet also has an example of the expected output.

On any slide which links to Dabblet, the sample output can be viewed by pressing the "down arrow" key on your keyboard. The expected output is displayed using an iframe.
