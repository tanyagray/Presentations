  So when you need help, ask for help. You will likely find it. 
  If not, ask someone else. Be willing to admit when you don't 
  know something. People appreciate honesty over false nods and 
  agreement, even if you feel silly for not knowing. Listen to 
  advice when you ask for it, and update the person later.
