  People love to help. They also love to talk about themselves. 
  If you're ever looking at someone thinking "wow I wish I could 
  be like them" or "I wish I knew how to do that", go and ask 
  them for advice. Don't panic about not knowing much, just 
  ask questions, show interest, and let them do the talking.
