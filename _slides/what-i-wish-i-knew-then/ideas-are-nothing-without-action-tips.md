  Use your free time wisely. There are only a certain number 
  of hours in the day but you can choose whether to use them 
  for achieving something meaningful, or for watching TV. 
  Watch less TV. See what else you can find to do instead. 
  Wherever possible, tell yourself to stop saying "I'll do 
  it tomorrow".
