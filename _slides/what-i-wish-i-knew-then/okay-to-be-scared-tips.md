notes: |
  If fear is something you have to deal with, know 
  that you are not alone. Channel it. Turn fear of 
  failure into fear of doing nothing. If something 
  is worth doing, it is worth doing badly. Never 
  say no straight away, always at least consider 
  saying yes. What is the worst that could happen? 
  What is the best? Never miss an opportunity. 
  Everything you make it through prepares you for 
  the next hurdle.
