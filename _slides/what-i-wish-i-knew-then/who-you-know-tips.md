  Remembering names goes a long way. If you're not good at 
  it don't worry, it is something you can learn - google it! 
  Do what you can to meet people from all walks of life. 
  Step outside your normal circles. Don't be afraid to name 
  drop. It's not always about bragging, sometimes it's just 
  a tiny endorsement that can capture someone's attention.
