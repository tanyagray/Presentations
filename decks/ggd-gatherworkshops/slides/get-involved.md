![Get involved](images/ggd-gatherworkshops.030.jpg)

Note:
There are probably more who I have forgotten, I'm sure there are. 

My point is, this is a problem we can fix. And people are working on it, but we need your help. 

So, I challenge you: choose one, or two, or all, and get involved. 

Lend a hand. 

You don't have to do a lot. Sometimes it's as little as an hour or so of your time to share your story, and inspire the next generation. 

Change perspectives, break stereotypes, be proud of your industry and show it.
