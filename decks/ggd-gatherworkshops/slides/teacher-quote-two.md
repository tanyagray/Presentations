![Quote from a teacher](images/ggd-gatherworkshops.021.jpg)

Note:
This, from a teacher taking refreshment leave for a year due to mental and physical fatigue.

"I still love the subject and teaching my students but the constant drive to make sure 80+% of the girls pass has me looking at dropping programming and taking subjects that are more 'student friendly'."

They go on to say "I am going to take time out and look at options that I can do that does not 'chew you up and spit you out' as much."
