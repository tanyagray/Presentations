Note:
A huge part of my new role has involved listening. 

That means reading teachers forums. That means going to teachersâ€™ conferences. It means trying to come to grips with a whole new industry. It also means being very careful that I don't just assume that I know best.

Finding the balance between fulfilling assessment requirements, retaining student interest, achievability of tasks, and keeping up with technology trends. That is HARD. 

I couldn't keep up while I was *in* the industry, let alone trying to do it from the outside as a teacher.
