![Quote from a teacher](images/ggd-gatherworkshops.020.jpg)

Note:
This is from a digi tech teacher working on-site 6 days a week, has been teaching 20 years, and is teaching mixed-level classes.

They also went on to say:

"I am probably too old and slow and am not showing enough efficiency. Plus I could do a lot of things a helluva lot better" - they know they need help, just not how or where to get it.
